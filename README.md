# odin-recipes
This is the introduction for the Odin Recipes project. 
In this project I will create a website in .html and commit to git.
When I'll complete the project, I will have developed the following skills : create an html website, use html elements, tags, attributes, links and images; commit projects to git through the command line. I'll develop a better understanding in the usage of the command line.
